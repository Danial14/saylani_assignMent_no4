          <p class="card-text">What Is the Internet of Things (IoT)?
            The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network comprised of physical objects capable of gathering and sharing electronic information. The Internet of Things includes a wide variety of “smart” devices, from industrial machines that transmit data about the production process to sensors that track information about the human body.
            
            <h3>How the Internet of Things Works</h3>
            These devices use Internet protocol (IP), the same protocol that identifies computers over the world wide web and allows them to communicate with one another. The goal behind the Internet of things is to have devices that self report in real-time, improving efficiency and bringing important information to the surface more quickly than a system depending on human intervention.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Benefits of the Internet of Things</h3>
            The Internet of Things promises to transform a wide range of fields. In medicine, for example, connected devices can help medical professionals monitor patients inside and outside of a hospital setting. Computers can then evaluate the data to help practitioners adjust treatments and improve patient outcomes.

            <h3>Applications of Internet of things</h3>
            <br/>
            <h4>IoT Sensors</h4>
            IoT sensors consist of manual or digital sensors connected to circuit boards such as Arduino Uno or Raspberry Pi 2. The circuit boards can be programmed to measure a range of data collected from a sensor device such as carbon monoxide, temperature, humidity, pressure, vibration, and motion.

What differentiates IoT sensors from simple sensors is that they can not only gather data at different physical environments but also send data to the connected devices.

The IoT sensors allow seamless control of data through automation delivering actionable insights. They can be used by businesses for predictive maintenance, enhanced efficiency, and reduced costs.

            <br/>
           <h4>Internet of things Data Analytics</h4>
           Businesses are increasingly using IoT data analytics to determine trends and patterns by analyzing big and small data. IoT data analytics apps can analyze structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data to extract meaningful insights.

IoT can be applied to data analytics to investigate different types of data including motion data sets, geographical data, and health care data. It can be used by businesses for predictive and descriptive analysis to improve customer knowledge, enhance operational efficiency, and create business value.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <h4>IoT Tracking and Monitoring System</h4>
           A lot of businesses are using IoT systems for asset tracking. IoT asset tracking devices use GPS or radio frequency (RF) to track and monitor properties. The smart devices can be used for long-range identification and verification of assets.
